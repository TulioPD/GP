# Procedural Generation Learning Project

This is a learning project that aims to implement procedural generation algorithms in a game context. The project currently includes a basic character generator as a starting point, but the ultimate goal is to create a sandbox game that relies heavily on procedural generation for various aspects such as level design, item generation, and enemy generation.

As such, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the proper permissions and licenses for any assets used in your own projects based on this code.

## Features

- Random generation of character stats

## TODO

- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for improved character generation
- Integration with a game engine to create a full game experience
- Ability for players to customize character appearances
- Ability to add new hair and body images to the game
- Consistent animations for all hair and body combinations
- User interface for displaying generated characters
- Implementation of Procedural Generation algorithms to create a 2D map representation
- Procedural Generation Algorithm to take the coordinates of the previously created 2D map and create another 2D map, with a platformer view, based on the first map terrain and features. The area created might be stored under some circunstances to easylly access to this scene (building)
- Terrain modification
- Politics
- Factions
- Weapon/Skill system
- Base building / colony management
- Job automatization system
- Automatic "turn combat system" to uncontrolled characters
- Character personalities and any class that inherits from Character in the future affects not also their random stat seed but also their behaviour and interactions with the world (unless directly controlled by player(maybe just some things ant the rest are still unaffected by direct player actions on the exact same moment))

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and open it with Unity

## Contributions

I'm not planning on adding new contributors at this time, but this will likely be a long-term project. Feel free to inquire about potential contributions in the future.
