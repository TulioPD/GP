# Procedural Generation Learning Project


This is a learning project that aims to implement procedural generation algorithms in a game context. The project currently includes a basic character generator as a starting point, but the ultimate goal is to create a game that relies heavily on procedural generation for various aspects such as level design, item generation, and enemy generation.

## Features

- Random generation of character stats

## TODO

-Implement machine learning algorithms for improved character generation
-Integrate with a game engine to create a full game experience
-Allow players to customize character appearances
-Add new hair and body images to the game
-Ensure consistent animations for all hair and body combinations
-Create a user interface for displaying generated characters
-Implement procedural generation algorithms to create a 2D map representation
-Create a procedural generation algorithm to take the coordinates of the previously created 2D map and create another 2D map with a platformer view based on the ---first map terrain and features
-Add terrain modification
-Include politics and factions
-Implement a weapon/skill system
-Develop base building and colony management

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and open it with Unity

## Contributions

I'm not planning on adding new contributors at the moment, but this will likely be a long project. Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested, but keep in mind that I may not be accepting contributions at this time.
