# Procedural Generation Learning Project


This is a learning project that aims to implement procedural generation algorithms in a game context. The project currently includes a basic character generator as a starting point, but the ultimate goal is to create a game that relies heavily on procedural generation for various aspects such as level design, item generation, and enemy generation.

## Features

- Random generation of character stats

## TODO

- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for improved character generation
- Integration with a game engine to create a full game experience
- Ability for players to customize character appearances
- Ability to add new hair and body images to the game
- Consistent animations for all hair and body combinations
- User interface for displaying generated characters
- Implementation of Procedural Generation algorithms to create a 2D map representation
- Procedural Generation Algorithm to take the coordinates of the previously created 2D map and create another 2D map, with a platformer view, based on the first map terrain and features. The area created might be stored under some circunstances to easylly access to this scene (building)
- Terrain modification
- Politics
- Factions
- Weapon/Skill system
- Base building / colony management

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and open it with Unity

## Contributions

I'm not planning on adding new Contributors but this will probably be a really long project. Feel free to ask at any given time, even tho I will probably not accept anybody right now
