# Procedural Generation Learning Project (PAUSED UNTIL I FINISH ANOTHER PROJECT)

This is a learning project that aims to implement procedural generation algorithms in a game context. The project currently includes a basic character generator as a starting point, but the ultimate goal is to create a sandbox game that relies heavily on procedural generation for various aspects such as level design, item generation, and enemy generation.

As such, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the proper permissions and licenses for any assets used in your own projects based on this code.

## Features

- Random generation of character stats

## TODO

- User interface for displaying generated characters
- Ability for players to customize character appearances
- Consistent animations for all hair and body combinations
- Integration with Unity game engine
- Implementation of Procedural Generation algorithms to create a 2D map representation
- Procedural Generation Algorithm to take the coordinates of the previously created 2D map and create another 2D map, with a platformer view, based on the first map terrain and features. The area created might be stored under some circumstances to easily access this scene (building)
- Terrain modification
- Weapon/Skill system
- Base building / colony management
- Politics
- Factions
- Automatic "turn combat system" to uncontrolled characters
- Job automation system
- Character personalities and any class that inherits from Character in the future affects not only their random stat seed but also their behavior and interactions with the world (unless directly controlled by the player(maybe just some things and the rest are still unaffected by direct player actions at the exact same moment))
- Ability to add new hair and body images to the game
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for improved character generation

## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and open it with Unity

## Contributions

I'm not planning on adding new contributors at this time, but this will likely be a long-term project. Feel free to inquire about potential contributions in the future.
