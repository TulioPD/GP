Procedural Generation Learning Project
This is a learning project that aims to implement procedural generation algorithms in a game context. The project currently includes a basic character generator as a starting point, but the ultimate goal is to create a game that relies heavily on procedural generation for various aspects such as level design, item generation, and enemy generation.

Character Generator
The current implementation of the character generator randomly generates characters with various attributes such as name, health points, level, experience, and appearance. The appearance of the character is currently limited to the body and hair images that are randomly assigned from a pre-existing set of options. However, the plan is to expand this to include more customizable options such as clothing, accessories, and facial features.

Future Plans
Implement procedural generation algorithms for level design, item generation, and enemy generation.
Add more customization options to the character generator such as clothing, accessories, and facial features.
Create a game that utilizes procedural generation heavily for a unique and unpredictable gameplay experience.
Research and implement different procedural generation algorithms such as Perlin noise, cellular automata, and L-systems.
Experiment with combining different procedural generation algorithms for more complex and unique results.
